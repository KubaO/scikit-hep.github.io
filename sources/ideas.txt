Forum on project ideas
======================

This page collects project ideas coming from either the Scikit-HEP team
or more broadly from anyone from the Scikit-HEP community.
Do get in touch if you would like to add an idea to this forum.
It will be the best way to raise awareness about your idea and
attract contributors!

Google Summer of Code 2017
--------------------------

Scikit-HEP is participating in the
`Google Summer of Code 2017 <https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/>`_
program with CERN as an organization, and under the umbrella of the
`HEP Software Foundation <http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/>`_,
see the direct `link <http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/gsoc.html>`_.

We have put forward
`2 proposals <http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/gsoc/project_SciKit-HEP.html>`_!
The direct links to the project proposals are the following:

* `Python bindings for the Hydra C++ library for analysis on massively
  multi-threaded platforms <http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/gsoc/proposal_ScikitHEP.html>`_.
  |Miscellaneous_open|
* `Visualization tools for Scikit-HEP <http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/gsoc/proposal_ScikitHEPviz.html>`_.
  |Visualization_open|


Simulation
----------

* Creation of a decay generator base class. A concrete class using ROOT's
  ``TGenPhaseSpace`` should be an immediate example.
  Contact `Eduardo` if you want to get involved. |Simulation_ongoing|
